# Schematize 

A small project aimed to improve my Python knowledge, probably, in the most inefficient and random way possible. First time using <s>Tkinter</s> Kivy and I don't even know if it's appropriate for this project or not.

A desktop app to put my life in schemes. Usually, I create these different types of schemes by hand, the majority on a lot of chaotic pieces of paper and only a few in a more organized "quadernetto" (notebook). Unfortunately, the "quadernetto"  has only a finite number of pages. 

## Type of schemes (problably I will able to implement 1 or 2, checkbox: implemented or not):

1. Time dependent: 
    - [ ] A simple summary calendar
    - [X] Daily routine, activities, and tasks manager (ONLY BASE/MINIMAL FEATURES) 
    - [ ] Weekly activities manager
    - [ ] More long-term goals/duty manager
    - [ ] Create short sessions (less than 24 hours, greater than 1 minute) plan to follow (like for study or workout)
2. Lists and leaderboard:
    - [ ] Random lists of stuff to remember
    - [ ] Lists of stuff related to "Time dependent" schemes
    - [ ] Create leaderboards about anything (e.g. favorite ice cream shop, sushi restaurant)
    - [ ] Checklist
    - [ ] Wishlist
3. Table form:
    - [ ] Pros and cons of anything
    - [ ] Table to help to buy stuff (e.g. list of possible products, pros, cons, some info, price, groupby...)
    - [ ] Budget manager
    - [ ] Table to organize thoughts about something complex (e.g. group by different approaches, level of abstraction, different priorities, etc...) 
    - [ ] Table checklist (simply 2d checklist, e.g. the extra axis can be time)
4. Sequencial and decision diagram
    - [ ] Decision diagram (e.g. if I chose this than...else...)
    - [ ] Diagram connected to "Table to help to buy stuff"
    - [ ] Diagram to visualize the sequence and connection of groups of things (I done in the past or I will do in the future)
